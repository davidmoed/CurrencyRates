# CurrencyRates
A simple Reactjs app that tracks the rates of USD, MXN, and ILS over the week of October 17-23. The Chart can be dragged around the screen, and resized.

## Usage:

Download the repository, and install Node and NPM on your CLI. First run `npm install` in the local directory.

To run the program, cd into the directory in your CLI and run `npm start`. If your browser doesn't automatically open, open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
